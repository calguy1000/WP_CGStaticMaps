# CGStaticMaps
## A Simple wordpress plugin to allow generating static maps on your Wordpress site

This simple plugin implements a widget type, and a shortcode to allow generating simple static maps using the Google static maps API.   It is also capable of caching the images on your server for up to 29 days.   

When adding a static map widget you can specify the map size in pixels, a single location using coordinates or an address, a zoom level, and the map type.   

When using a shortcode there are many more options, including the ability to specify a center, a location that must be visible, and multiple markers.
